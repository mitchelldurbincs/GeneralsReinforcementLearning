Simple Plan 
1.  **Core Game Engine & Local Setup** 🎮🧪🐳
    * Finalize game logic and comprehensive unit/integration tests.
    * Initial Docker integration (`Dockerfile.go_server`).
    * Implement a strong, structured logging framework (e.g., `slog`).

2.  **Basic gRPC Services & Game Server** 📡⚙️
    * Define and implement initial `GameService` gRPC (Create, Join, SubmitAction).
    * Develop the Go Game Server to manage game lifecycles and state.
    * Test with simple CLI clients.

3.  **Replay System & Initial Data Pipeline** 📝💾
    * Implement `GameService.GetReplay`.
    * Design and implement `ReplayService` (gRPC: `RecordExperience`, `GetExperienceBatch`).
    * Ensure game server can capture and send necessary data (states, actions, rewards) to `ReplayService`.
    * Plan for S3 storage for replays/experiences.

4.  **Python RL Environment & Basic Agent** 🤖🐍
    * Develop Python gRPC client for `GameService` and `ReplayService`.
    * Create `GeneralsEnv(gymnasium.Env)` wrapper.
        * `reset()` calls `GameService.CreateGame`.
        * `step(action)` calls `GameService.SubmitAction`, gets `next_state, reward, done`.
        * Experiences sent to `ReplayService.RecordExperience`.
    * Implement a basic RL agent (e.g., DQN with Stable Baselines3).
    I think that I want to use a GRU from the start as well. 
    * Initial observation/action space design and reward function.

5.  **Local RL Training Loop & Metrics** 🔄📊
    * Get a proof-of-concept training loop running locally (Python agent ↔ Go game server ↔ Replay service).
    * Implement core RL training metrics (episode reward, length, steps/sec, replay buffer size).
    * Beginner Ebitengine UI for basic visualization (optional at this stage, could be later).

6.  **Self-Play Mechanics & Evaluation** ⚔️📈
    * Implement saving/loading of agent model snapshots.
    * Basic `ModelService` (gRPC: `GetPolicy`, `PublishPolicy`).
    * Develop logic for actors to fetch policies and play against snapshots.
    * Introduce Elo rating system:
        * Define `EloService` (or module within `MatchMakerService` or `ModelService`) for tracking policy Elo.
        * Actors report game outcomes for Elo updates.
    * Enable human vs. bot gameplay via UI or CLI.

7.  **Cloud Infrastructure Setup (Proof of Concept)** ☁️🏗️
    * Containerize Python RL components (`Dockerfile.python_rl`).
    * Set up basic AWS infrastructure:
        * ECR for Docker images.
        * ECS/EKS for running Game Server (Go) and RL Actors (Python CPU).
        * S3 for replays and models.
        * Initial IAM roles and security groups.
    * CI/CD basics (e.g., GitHub Actions for builds & ECR push).

8.  **Single GPU Cloud Training & Scaling Actors** 💻➡️☁️
    * Deploy RL Learner to a GPU instance on AWS (e.g., EC2 P/G series).
    * Learner fetches batches from `ReplayService` and publishes models via `ModelService`.
    * Scale out RL actors (CPU instances) generating experience in parallel.

9.  **Advanced RL & Distributed Training Refinements** 🚀📈
    * Implement more advanced self-play strategies (e.g., tournament system via `MatchMakerService`, exploiters).
    * Refine reward function, observation/action spaces.
    * Explore more advanced RL algorithms/improvements (e.g., Rainbow DQN elements).
    * Optimize data pipeline and address bottlenecks.

10. **Monitoring, Optimization & Multi-GPU (Future)** 🧐🛠️
    * Enhance monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch).
    * Performance profiling and optimization of Go server and Python RL pipeline.
    * Consider multi-GPU/multi-node training for the learner if needed.
