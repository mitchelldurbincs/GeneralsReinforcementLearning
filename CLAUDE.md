# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Important Note 1:** 
- If you are working from an implementation markdown file, using - [ ] to signify new tasks and mark your tasks completed with - [x] once you are done please. 

## Project Overview

This is a Go-based implementation of a Generals.io-style strategic territory control game designed specifically for reinforcement learning research and training. The game features army movement, territory capture, and fog of war mechanics. 

**Important Note**: This is NOT a multiplayer game server. While the codebase includes networking infrastructure (gRPC), it's intended for:
- Training reinforcement learning agents through self-play
- Running distributed RL training across multiple machines
- Occasional human play for testing agent performance
- Bot vs bot competitions in controlled environments

The project prioritizes RL training efficiency over production multiplayer features like security, authentication, or public-facing APIs.

### Game Mechanics
- **Turn-based strategy**: Players take turns moving armies
- **Territory control**: Capture tiles by moving armies onto them
- **Army production**: Generals and cities produce 1 army per turn
- **Combat**: Larger army wins when armies meet, difference remains
- **Victory conditions**: Capture all enemy generals or control entire map
- **Map features**: Mountains (impassable), cities (capturable for production)

## Event System Architecture

The game uses an event-driven architecture to decouple core game logic from auxiliary systems:

### Event Types
- **Game Lifecycle**: GameStarted, GameEnded, StateTransition
- **Turn Management**: TurnStarted, TurnEnded
- **Actions**: ActionSubmitted, ActionValidated, ActionExecuted, ActionRejected
- **Combat**: CombatStarted, CombatResolved, TilesCaptured, TilesLost
- **Player**: PlayerJoined, PlayerLeft, PlayerEliminated, PlayerWon
- **Production**: ProductionApplied, CityProduced, GeneralProduced

### Event Flow
1. Game engine publishes events during turn processing
2. Event bus distributes events synchronously to all subscribers
3. Subscribers can be added for logging, metrics, RL data collection, etc.
4. Action processor publishes events via EventPublisherAdapter

### Usage Example
```go
// Subscribe to events
eventBus.Subscribe(func(event events.Event) {
    switch e := event.(type) {
    case *events.TurnStartedEvent:
        // Handle turn start
    case *events.ActionExecutedEvent:
        // Collect RL experience
    }
})
```

## State Machine Integration

The game now includes a formal state machine to manage game lifecycle:

### Game Phases
1. **PhaseInitializing**: Game object creation
2. **PhaseLobby**: Players joining, configuration
3. **PhaseStarting**: Map generation, player placement
4. **PhaseRunning**: Active gameplay (only phase that accepts actions)
5. **PhasePaused**: Temporary suspension
6. **PhaseEnding**: Winner determination, cleanup
7. **PhaseEnded**: Final state
8. **PhaseError**: Error recovery state
9. **PhaseReset**: Reset without full teardown

### State Transitions
- Initializing â†’ Lobby â†’ Starting â†’ Running
- Running â†” Paused (pause/resume)
- Running â†’ Ending â†’ Ended
- Any â†’ Error (on unrecoverable error)
- Error/Ended â†’ Reset â†’ Initializing

### Engine Integration
- Engine checks state before processing actions
- State transitions publish events
- Pause/Resume methods available on Engine
- Single-player games supported (for RL training)

**Note**: gRPC endpoints still need to be updated to respect state machine

## Development Notes

### Key Implementation Details

When modifying game mechanics, key files to consider:
- Game balance: `internal/game/constants.go`
- Turn processing: `internal/game/engine.go`
- Movement logic: `internal/game/core/movement.go`
- Visual rendering: `internal/ui/renderer/`
- Fog of war: `internal/game/visibility.go`
- Performance optimization: Check incremental update patterns in `stats.go` and `visibility.go`
- gRPC APIs: `internal/grpc/proto/game.proto`
- Python integration: `python/` directory
- Event handling: `internal/game/events/`
- State management: `internal/game/states/`

### Important Architectural Decisions

1. **Event System**: Uses synchronous event dispatch for simplicity and determinism. Events include timestamps and game IDs for tracking.

2. **State Machine**: Enforces valid game lifecycle transitions. Single-player games are allowed for RL training scenarios.

3. **Performance**: The codebase uses incremental updates for visibility and stats calculations to optimize performance during RL training.

4. **Testing**: When adding new features, ensure tests handle both single-player and multi-player scenarios.

5. **Logging**: Use structured logging with zerolog. Include relevant context (game ID, turn, player ID) in log entries.

### Common Patterns

- **Incremental Updates**: Used in visibility and stats for performance
- **Reusable Maps**: Engine pre-allocates maps to avoid GC pressure
- **Event Publishing**: All significant game actions publish events
- **State Validation**: State transitions validate preconditions
- **Error Handling**: Use wrapped errors with context for debugging

### TODO/Known Issues

- gRPC server needs to integrate with state machine for proper game lifecycle management
- StreamGame method needs completion for real-time updates
- Python RL agent implementations are in progress
- Experience collector interface is defined but needs concrete implementations

The project uses:
- **Zerolog** for structured logging throughout the codebase
- **Ebiten v2.8.8** for game graphics and rendering
- **gRPC 1.70.0** for client-server communication
- **Viper** for configuration management
- **Testify** for testing assertions
- **Go 1.24.0** as the base language version
- **Python 3.8+** for RL agent development
