# Gemini Code Assistant Documentation

This document provides an overview of the GeneralsReinforcementLearning project, generated by the Gemini Code Assistant.
Reminder: *There is a todo.md that you can follow that is in ./documentation!!*
## Project Overview

This project is a Go-based implementation of a turn-based strategy game, similar to the game of Generals. It includes a game engine, a client-server architecture for gameplay, and a user interface built with the Ebiten game engine. The project is structured to support reinforcement learning research, with a clear separation between the game logic and the training environment.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

-   **`game_server`**: A command-line application that runs a game simulation with random actions. This is likely intended to be used as a training environment for a reinforcement learning agent.
-   **`ui_client`**: A graphical user interface (GUI) application that visualizes the game and allows for human interaction. This is useful for debugging, analysis, and manual testing.

## Core Components

The project is organized into several key packages:

-   **`cmd`**: Contains the entry points for the `game_server` and `ui_client` applications.
-   **`internal/game`**: Implements the core game logic, including the game engine, state representation, and rules.
-   **`internal/game/core`**: Defines the fundamental components of the game, such as the board, tiles, actions, and movement mechanics.
-   **`internal/ui`**: Implements the user interface using the Ebiten game engine.
-   **`deploy`**: Contains Docker and Terraform files for deploying the application.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Run the game server (for simulations)
go run ./cmd/game_server

# Run the UI client (for visualization)
go run ./cmd/ui_client
```

## Game Mechanics

The game is played on a 2D grid with the following tile types:

-   **Normal**: Regular tiles that can be owned by players.
-   **General**: The player's main unit. If a player's general is captured, they are eliminated from the game.
-   **City**: Special tiles that provide additional army production.
-   **Mountain**: Impassable tiles that block movement.

Players can move their armies between adjacent tiles to attack and capture enemy tiles. The goal of the game is to eliminate all other players by capturing their generals.

## Reinforcement Learning

The project is well-suited for reinforcement learning research. The `game_server` can be used as a training environment, and the `internal/game` package provides a clear API for interacting with the game state and action space. The following components are particularly relevant for RL:

-   **`GameState`**: Represents the current state of the game, including the board, players, and other relevant information.
-   **`Action`**: Defines the actions that can be taken by a player, such as moving armies.
-   **`Engine`**: The game engine, which processes actions and advances the game state.

By implementing a reinforcement learning agent that interacts with the game engine, you can train a model to play the game and learn optimal strategies.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed using Docker and Terraform. The `deploy` directory contains the necessary files for building a Docker image and provisioning the required infrastructure on AWS.

### Docker

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build to create a minimal Docker image for the `game_server`. This image can be used to run the game server in a containerized environment.

### Terraform

The `terraform` directory contains a set of Terraform files that define the project's infrastructure as code. The infrastructure is designed to run on AWS and includes the following components:

These are incomplete !! Gonna wait a while before doing these, but wanted to get the skeleton in.

There is a todo.md that you can follow that is in ./documentation!!
